# `phpdbg` for fun and profit

## What is it?

Command oriented debugger.

Runs from the command line.

Effectively like running PHP CLI except with interactivity.

## How do I get it?

Bundled with PHP source code since 5.6: --enable-phpdbg

Packaged on Debian and Ubuntu. (Check CentOS/RHEL.)

Homebrew includes an option in PHP 5.4+. (check if default)

## Using it for debugging

### CLI case (message queue?)

Start with a really contrived case (FizzBuzz handler)

### Web case

Adapter atop a front controller. (example in phpdbg docs; write a small package)

## Using it with PHPUnit

Code coverage.

## IDEs

## Comparison to XDebug (when to use it?)

## Questions, etc
